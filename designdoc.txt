DBDPerkRandomizer Website

How do I want it designed?

Home:
In the middle of the screen. There will be two options. On the left most side there will be the Killer PNG, potentially have a heading above it saying "Killer Perk Randomizer" or maybe just the PNG is enough. On the right most side there will be the Survivor PNG. Dark grey background.

Killer and Survivor:
When entering the page, in the middle, there will be 4 random perk images for you to try in a hexagonal shape.[dun]
When hovered over each perk, there will be a tooltip that has the name at the top, description at the bottom, and the tagline of the perk.[WIP]
In order to re-randomize the perks I am going have a dice in the middle of the perks and once clicked it will refresh the page. [DUN]
BG image will be the DBD Logo.[DUN]

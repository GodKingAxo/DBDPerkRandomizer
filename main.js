// Array with every killer and survivor perk image
// Array with description of each 

//Maybe a map with the image as the key and description as the value. Description would have an array within it. [name, description, tagline]

//I am going to put my thoughts here. I was going to link the perk title, images, and description by just using array zero indexing or w/e [0] = bamboozle ect. That might be the easiest way, but its the only way that makes sense to me right now. After I tie those three things, I need to create logic to flip through each image when the dice is clicked and after a delay give the randomized perks, with correct descriptions.

//Actual easiest way is the create a class and instantiate each perk. After make it into an array.
